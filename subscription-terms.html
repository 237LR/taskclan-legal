            <h3>Setting Up Family Sharing</h3>
            <p>Family Sharing must be configured through your Apple ID settings. Visit Apple's support site for instructions on setting up Family Sharing.</p>

            <h2>Geographic Availability</h2>
            <p>HomeHero subscriptions are available worldwide wherever the Apple App Store operates. Prices may vary by country and are displayed in your local currency in the App Store.</p>

            <h2>Taxes</h2>
            <p>Subscription prices do not include applicable taxes. Taxes are calculated and charged by Apple based on your billing address and local tax laws.</p>

            <h2>Subscription Transfer</h2>
            <p>Subscriptions are tied to your Apple ID and cannot be transferred to another Apple ID. If you change devices but use the same Apple ID, your subscription will remain active.</p>

            <h2>Restoration of Purchases</h2>
            <p>If you reinstall HomeHero or install it on a new device with the same Apple ID, you can restore your subscription at no charge. Use the "Restore Purchases" option in the app.</p>

            <h2>Service Interruptions</h2>
            <p>While we strive for 99.9% uptime, we do not guarantee uninterrupted access to premium features. We are not liable for temporary service interruptions, but we will work to resolve issues promptly.</p>

            <h2>Changes to Features</h2>
            <p>We may add, modify, or remove premium features at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify subscribers of significant changes to features included in their subscription.</p>

            <h2>Account Termination</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to terminate your subscription and access to premium features if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Violate these Subscription Terms or our Terms of Service</li>
                <li>Engage in fraudulent activity</li>
                <li>Abuse or exploit the service</li>
                <li>Share your account with non-family members</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Terminated accounts are not eligible for refunds.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Subscription management uses RevenueCat for subscription analytics and cross-platform support. RevenueCat's privacy policy and terms apply to their services.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            <p>We may update these Subscription Terms from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via email or in-app notification. Your continued use of premium features after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
